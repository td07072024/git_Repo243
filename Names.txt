The Philippine eagle has numerous native names in the Philippine languages. These include bánoy and ágila (a Spanish loanword) in Tagalog; manaul or manaol in the Visayan languages; manaol or garuda in Maranao and Maguindanao; tipule in Subanen; and mam-boogook or malamboogook in the Manobo languages, Klata, Tagabawa, Mandaya, and Kalagan. Some of these names are also used for other large eagles in general, such as the white-breasted sea eagle (also called manaul in Visayan). In modern Filipino, it is usually referred to as háribon (a portmanteau of "háring ibon", literally "bird king").
