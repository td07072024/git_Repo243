Evolution in the Philippines, without other predators, made the eagles the dominant hunter in the Philippine forests. The Philippine eagle has a wide range of prey which includes birds, reptiles and mammals (mainly civets and colugos).[31] Each breeding pair requires a large home range to successfully raise a chick, thus the species is extremely vulnerable to deforestation. Earlier, the territory has been estimated at 100 km2 (39 mi2), but a study on Mindanao Island found the nearest distance between breeding pairs to be about 13 km (8.1 mi) on average, resulting in a circular plot of 133 km2 (51 mi2).[32]

The species' flight is fast and agile, resembling the smaller hawks more than similar large birds of prey.[33]

Juveniles in play behavior have been observed gripping knotholes in trees with their talons, and using their tails and wings for balance, inserting their heads into tree cavities.[34] Additionally, they have been known to attack inanimate objects for practice, as well as attempt to hang upside down to work on their balance.[34] As the parents are not nearby when this occurs, they apparently do not play a role in teaching the juvenile to hunt.[34]

Life expectancy for a wild eagle is estimated to be from 30 to 60 years. A captive Philippine eagle lived for 41 years in Rome Zoo, and it was already an adult when it arrived at the zoo.[34] Another captive Philippine eagle lived for 46 years at the Philippine Eagle Center in Davao City.[35] However, wild birds on average are believed to live shorter lives than captive birds.
